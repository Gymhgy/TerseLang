Welcome to the Repl.it for Terse, the shortest coding language. Terse aims to be able to write problems in as little bytes as possible.

## How do I program in Terse?
Go to the [spec file](https://github.com/Gymhgy/TerseLang/blob/master/spec.md). It has all the info you need to construct programs in Terse.

## How do I run the interpreter?
Press the **run** button at the very top. By default Terse runs in interactive mode. Type your program on the first line, and the arguments on the second line.

If you wish to run in a different mode, there are two other ways:
```
Usage: mono terse [-f path|-p program] [arguments...]
```

## Where do I find the list of functions?
The docs aren't complete yet. Once they're done, however, they'll be in the [Functions.md](https://github.com/Gymhgy/TerseLang/blob/master/functions.md) file

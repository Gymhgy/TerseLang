Welcome to Terse, the shortest coding language. Terse aims to be able to write problems in as little bytes as possible.

## How do I program in Terse?
Go to the [wiki](https://github.com/Gymhgy/TerseLang/wiki). It has all the info you need to construct programs in Terse.

## How do I run the interpreter?

```
Usage: mono terse [-f path|-p program] [arguments...]
```

## Where do I find the list of functions?
The docs aren't complete yet. Once they're done, however, they'll be in the [Functions.md](https://github.com/Gymhgy/TerseLang/blob/master/functions.md) file
